# Customer Segmentation for a Bank

The goal of this project is to perform customer segmentation for a bank using the Bank Marketing Dataset. The bank wants to better understand its customer base in order to provide more targeted and personalized services to its customers. By segmenting customers into distinct groups based on their characteristics and behavior, the bank can tailor its marketing strategies, product offerings, and customer service initiatives to better meet the needs of each group.

## The objectives of this project are as follows:
* Perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and identify any data quality issues that need to be addressed.
* Preprocess the data to prepare it for analysis, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features as necessary.
* Use unsupervised machine learning techniques to cluster customers into distinct segments based on their characteristics and behavior.
* Evaluate the performance of the clustering algorithm(s) using appropriate metrics.
* Interpret and visualize the results of the clustering to gain insights into the customer segments and their characteristics.
* Use the results of the clustering to inform the bankâ€™s marketing strategies, product offerings, and customer service initiatives.

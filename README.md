# Customer Segmentation for a Bank

The goal of this project is to perform customer segmentation for a bank using the Bank Marketing Dataset. The bank wants to better understand its customer base in order to provide more targeted and personalized services to its customers. By segmenting customers into distinct groups based on their characteristics and behavior, the bank can tailor its marketing strategies, product offerings, and customer service initiatives to better meet the needs of each group.
